// JavaScript Comparison Operators

// Comparison operators compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false.

/**
 * ==	Equal to: true if the operands are equal	5==5; //true
 * !=	Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal	5!=5; //false
 * ===	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type	5==='5'; //false
 * !==	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	5!=='5'; //true
 * >	Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand	3>2; //true
 * >=	Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	3>=3; //true
 * <	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	3<2; //false
 * <=	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	2<=2; //true
