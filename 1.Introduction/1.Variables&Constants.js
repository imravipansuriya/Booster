/*================================
        JavaScript Variables
==================================*/

// In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

/**
 * var  :- var is used in the older versions of JavaScript, var is function scoped.
 * let  :- let is the new way of declaring variables starting ES6 (ES2015), let is block scoped.
 * const:- The const keyword was also introduced in the ES6(ES2015) version to create constants. Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.
