/**

Primitive Data Types: A primitive data type is pre-defined by the programming language. 
                      The size and type of variable values are specified, and it has no additional methods. 
                      
Non-Primitive Data Types: These data types are not actually defined by the programming 
                          language but are created by the programmer.
