        Type Conversions
==================================*/

// In programming, type conversion is the process of converting data of one type to another. For example: converting String data to Number.

// Implicit Conversion - automatic type conversion
// Explicit Conversion - manual type conversion

/*

> JavaScript Implicit Conversion
    In certain situations, JavaScript automatically converts 
    one data type to another (to the right type). This is known as implicit conversion.

/*

> JavaScript Explicit Conversion
    You can also convert one data type to another as per your needs.
    The type conversion that you do manually is known as explicit type conversion.
